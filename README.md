# python-project - Yea Young and Todd Camnitz
Parking lot OOP with Todd

Summary of author contributions:

Todd and Yea largely collaborated simultaneously on nearly all of the code. 

Yea was the original author for the initial modules that the main py script imports;
she built the draft structure for tickey.py and ascii.py prior to our collab session,
but the collab session altered significant portions of these files as our structure and
code took shape.

During collab, we both switched off coding throughout the process, working together to
write the code in main, edit the code in the draft ticket.py module, and develop our
final parking garage structure and logic. We didn't assign specific sections; rather 
everything we wrote was done in real time together.

Because of the collaborative nature of our process, we decided it didn't make sense to
try to write out in the scripts exactly who did what.
